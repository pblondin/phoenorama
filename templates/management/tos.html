<h3>Subscription Agreement</h3>
<hr />

<p>This Trial Subscription Agreement, including the information submitted to Qualys upon your request for the Service ("Registration"), sets forth an agreement (the "Agreement") between [Your Company's Name] ("End-User") and Qualys, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Qualys"), for a limited trial subscription to the Qualys service (the "Service"), whether End-User obtained its trial subscription from Qualys or an authorized reseller of Qualys ("Authorized Reseller").</p>

<p>1. Trial Subscription. Upon End-User's completion of Registration and Qualys' acceptance of End-User's Registration request, subject to End-User's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, End-User will be entitled to use the Service solely for the limited trial period, for the number of scan(s), and for the IP address(s) and domain name(s) specified during Registration. To increase or change the number of scans, IP addresses and/or domain names covered by the Service, or to extend the Service beyond a limited trial subscription, End-User must purchase a paid subscription.</p>

<p>2. Restrictions. End-User's use of the Service is subject to the following restrictions and End-User hereby covenants as follows: (a) End-User may use the Service only to scan IP addresses and/or map domain names owned by and registered to End-User, or for which End-User otherwise has the full right, power, and authority to consent to scan. (b) End-User may not use the Service except for the limited purpose of accessing the Service's user interface and reviewing, solely for End-User's own internal business purposes, only such vulnerability test results as set forth in the reports of IP address scans provided by Qualys (the "Reports"). (c) While there is no software transfer necessary from Qualys to End-User to effectuate the Service, End-User agrees not to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software that provides the Service, or otherwise attempt to derive the processes by which the Service is provided or the Reports are generated, except to the extent the foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. (d) Upon termination or expiration of the trial period, End-User must cease all use of the Service, including any downloads of Reports.</p>

<p>3. Card Programs. At End-User's request and upon payment of relevant fees, Qualys will provide End-User, as part of the Service, a customized version of the Reports containing information designed to meet the criteria of a Qualys-supported payment card compliance program such as, by way of example, the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (each a "Card Program"). Qualys provides the Service in connection with Card Programs, including any customized Reports, solely as a tool to enable End-User to evaluate its compliance with such Card Programs. End-User acknowledges and agrees that third party payment card organizations, and not Qualys, establish the security criteria and other terms and conditions of the Card Programs ("Criteria").</p>

<p>4. Ownership and Confidentiality. All intellectual proprietary rights now known or hereafter recognized in any jurisdiction in and to the Service and the Reports are owned by Qualys and its licensors. End-User agrees to make no claim of interest therein or ownership thereto. End-User further acknowledges that the Service's structure, organization, and code are the valuable trade secrets of Qualys and/or its licensors, and all data and information contained within the Service or the Reports (excluding individual factual data gathered form the End-User's network IP addresses) are confidential information of Qualys. End User agrees to keep such information in confidence and not to disclose it to any third parties. End-User may not access, use or refer to any such information except for the limited purpose of generating Reports for IP addresses for which the End-User has requested scans, and using such Reports for internal business purposes, solely for the purpose of vulnerability assessment with regard to the relevant IP address.</p>

<p>5. IP Addresses; Indemnity. (a) End-User represents and warrants that End-User has full right, power, and authority to consent to have the Service scan for vulnerabilities the IP addresses or domain names identified to Qualys for scanning, whether electronically or by any other means, whether during initial Registration or thereafter. End-User will indemnify and hold harmless Qualys, its Authorized Resellers, partners and sponsors, and their officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any third-party claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, awards, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by or levied against the same resulting from or based on End-User's use of or inability to use the Service, including any claim resulting from End-User's breach of this Section 5. (b) End-User also acknowledges and agrees that the scanning of such IP addresses and/or domain names may expose vulnerabilities and in some circumstances could result in the disruption of services at such site(s). Certain optional features of the Service, including exploitive scans, involve substantial risk of Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, loss of service, hardware failure and loss or corruption of data. Consequently, End-User assumes the risk for all damages, losses and expenses resulting from use of the Service.</p>

<p>6. Warranty Disclaimer. THE SERVICE AND REPORTS ARE BEING PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND QUALYS, ITS AUTHORIZED RESELLERS, PARTNERS AND SPONSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUALITY, ACCURACY AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. Without limiting the foregoing, Qualys makes no warranty that the Service will be error-free, complete, free from interruption or failure, or absolutely secure from unauthorized access, or that the Service will detect every vulnerability to End-User's network. Qualys does not warrant that the Service or the Reports meet the Criteria of any Card Program; nor should End-User rely on a "Pass" designation in a Report or the statements of Qualys personnel regarding a Card Program as an indication that End-User's network is secure.</p>

<p>7. Limitation of Liability. THIS TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION IS BEING PROVIDED TO END-USER FREE OF CHARGE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL QUALYS, ITS SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, OR AUTHORIZED RESELLERS, BE LIABLE TO END-USER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, APPLICATION OR EQUIPMENT DOWNTIME, OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF END-USER'S USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, EVEN IF QUALYS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL QUALYS' AND ITS AUTHORIZED RESELLERS' TOTAL LIABILITY TO END-USER FOR ALL DAMAGES IN ANY ONE OR MORE CAUSES OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED $100.</p>

<p>8. General. End-User agrees to comply with all applicable laws in its use of the Service, including all applicable export control laws. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any dispute between End-User and Qualys regarding this Agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County in the State of California. This Agreement is the entire agreement between End-User and Qualys and supersedes any other communications or advertising with respect to the Service and documentation. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed waived or modified except in a writing signed by an authorized representative of Qualys. There are no implied licenses hereunder. End-User may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Qualys.</p>
